TinyMUX 2.0:  BETA 6
Last Update:  March 2000

General Cautions During the Beta Period:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TinyMUX 2.0 has been tested in various situations and stress loads from 
games like Pacifica for nearly a year.  It has been running working 
production games for as long under close watch from the devteam.  We've 
thrown trashy ansi and nightmarish databases at it, made it do 
terrible things that made it choke, turn blue, and crash.  We even let
Ashen-Shugar beat on it a while.  

As a result of this abuse, 283 bugs have been fixed. Even though there are
28 bugs still left to fix, these are mostly feature requests. There are no
known crashing bugs. There are no known priority 1 bugs left.  These stats
don't make the server bug free, but we are confident enough to put the
code into Beta release to see what others might show up along the way.
However, it is our belief, that this is the best and most stable version
of TinyMUX available.

Please take the time to read the expanded and updated README.  These files 
should be helpful.  If there are problems with them, please report it as a
documentation bug and we'll make sure it gets fixed.

If you port an existing game to this beta:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Make frequent backups.  We cannot stress this enough.  The included 
      Backup script is your friend and should make this process effortless. 
    
    - Make complete backups of all of your config, text, mail, and 
      comsystems.
    
    - Store your backups offsite.  This was always prudent anyway.
    
    - Run your game as usual.
    
    - Report Bugs to sdennis@svdltd.com following the prcedure in README.


If you start a new game to this beta:

    - Store your backups offsite.  This was always prudent anyway.
    
    - Keep decompiles of anything really big, unique, or irreplaceable 
      softcode.  This is good coding practice, anyway.
    
    - Run your game as usual.
