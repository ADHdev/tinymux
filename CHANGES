TinyMUX 2.1:  CHANGES
Last Update:  June 2001

Major changes that may affect performance and require softcode tweaks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Signals SIGINT and SIGUSR2 have been swapped. SIGINT now performs a
    @shutdown, and SIGUSR2 drops a .SIG flatfile.

Feature Additions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Support and favor %x ANSI substitutions over %c ANSI substitutions,
    but both are recognized.
 -- Changed PORTS() function to allow a player to get their own port number.
 -- Evaluating comtitles.
 -- comtitle/on and comtitle/off.
 -- LASTIP saves the numerical IP address from the players connection.
 -- @wait/until allows one to give an absolute time stamp.
 -- @wait and @wait/until support fractional seconds (eg. @wait 1.5=<cmd>).
 -- Added command access for UNINSPECTED and NO_UNINSPECTED.
 -- Added %m for 'lastcommand'. Equivalent to %c in MUSH.
 -- Exits can be teleported from room to room instead of taken and dropped.
 -- Added generalized article guessing (see art() and article_rule).
 -- Support 36 global registers instead of 10.

Bug Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~
 -- inet_addr() re-write to handle netmask of 255.255.255.255 and Berkeley
    a, a.b, and a.b.c numeric IP formats.

Performance Enhancements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Parser is faster in recognizing %-escapes.
 -- Parser function handling is improved with minimum and maximum range
    checking handled in the parser and not in each individual function.
 -- Database and hashtables use a different hash function which is easier
    for gcc to optimize and therefore, Unix distro should benefit.
    Actually, new hash function is faster than anything else I've found
    for all block sizes from 1-byte up.
 -- For string search with GREP and GREPI, added a Boyer-Moore-Horspool
    string search algorithm for speed.

Cosmetic Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Miscellaneous:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Added Manual in LaTeX format.
