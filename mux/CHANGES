TinyMUX 2.4:  CHANGES
Last Update:  May 2004

Major changes that may affect performance and require softcode tweaks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- The units on the timeslice configuration option have changed from
    milliseconds to seconds.  Milliseconds was an integer, where as
    seconds can be a fraction.  So, this change doesn't take anything away.


Feature Additions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Added support for multi-character delimiters across nearly all
    functions which accept input or output delimiters.  For example,
    'iter(1%r2%r3,itext(),%r,|)' produces '1|2|3'.
 -- Added 'reset_players' configuration option which resets the player
    connection record.
 -- Added 'user_attrib_per_hour' which limits the rate at which
    user-defined attributes are created.
 -- Added 'mail_per_hour' which limits the rate at which @mail can be
    created.
 -- Add output delimiter to elements(), extract(), filter(),
    filterbool(), graball(), remove(), shuffle(), sortby(), and
    splice().
 -- Connection, disconnection, partial, and suspect emits now show the
    player's @moniker.
 -- Added lag_limit configuration option that control how long the server
    will service commands.  The execution of expensive commands is
    abbreviated.
 -- On Win32, use higher-quality time from QueryPerformanceCounter() on
    Win32 instead of GetSystemTimeAsFileTime().  As soon as the error
    from using QueryPerformanceCounter() drops below 5ms, the server switches
    to using it as a time source.  So, if you are doing any softcode
    profiling on Win32, you need to wait a few seconds after the server is
    started before beginning your tests.


Bug Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~
 -- Solaris build needed a missing HAVE_FCNTL_H.
 -- First argument argument of udefault(), edefault(), and default()
    supported <dbref>/<attrname>, but not just <attrname>.  But
    introduced in MUX 2.2 timeframe.
 -- While the server hasn't allowed mail aliases (@malias) larger than
    100 members for awhile, it did not protect itself properly against
    mail aliases saved in older mail.db files.
 -- @backup now works with MEMORY_BASED build.
 -- Added missing @fsay help topic.
 -- Added more messages to @destroy/instant path.
 -- Guest attributes weren't being wiped as intended.


Performance Enhancements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Re-worked update_quotas() so that mudstate.now could be removed.
 -- Use nanosleep() or usleep() on Unix if available.


Cosmetic Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Increased the space available to WHO for @moniker names to provide
    more room for more ANSI transitions.


Miscellaneous:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Added ATTACK notes.
