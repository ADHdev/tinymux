TinyMUX 2.4:  CHANGES
Last Update:  July 2005

Major changes that may affect performance and require softcode tweaks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- The units on the timeslice configuration option have changed from
    milliseconds to seconds.  But, seconds can be expressed as a
    fraction whereas milliseconds could only be expressed as an
    integer, so this change doesn't take any capability away.
 -- Control over WOD Realms, Memory-Based, and other build options
    have been pulled back into the ./configure script.  The README
    files refer to the new methods, and ./configure --help gives a list.
    Also, gmake is no longer necessary for *BSD flavors.
 -- The behavior of case() is closer to switch().  The patterns are now
    evaluated.  The #$ substitution is also made.


Feature Additions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Added support for multi-character delimiters across nearly all
    functions which accept input or output delimiters.  For example,
    'iter(1%r2%r3,itext(),%r,|)' produces '1|2|3'.
 -- Added 'reset_players' configuration option which resets the player
    connection record.
 -- Added 'user_attrib_per_hour' which limits the rate at which
    user-defined attribute names are created.
 -- Added 'mail_per_hour' which limits the rate at which @mail can be
    created.
 -- Add output delimiter to elements(), extract(), filter(),
    filterbool(), graball(), remove(), shuffle(), sortby(), and
    splice().
 -- Connection, disconnection, partial, and suspect emits now show the
    player's @moniker.
 -- Added lag_limit configuration option to control how long the
    server will service commands.  The execution of expensive commands
    is abbreviated, and the queue is drained, and the executor is
    @set HALTED.  lag_maximum continues to be the reporting threshold.
 -- On Win32, use higher-quality time from QueryPerformanceCounter()
    instead of GetSystemTimeAsFileTime().  As soon as the error from
    using QueryPerformanceCounter() drops below 5ms, the server
    switches to using it as a time source.  So, if you are doing any
    softcode profiling on Win32, you need to wait a few seconds after
    the server is started before beginning your tests.
 -- Updated PCRE from version 4.2 to version 4.5.
 -- Added BXOR() function.
 -- Added siteadmin @power to permit mortals to operate @shutdown and
    @restart.  The idea is that the site administrator will have access
    to the shell account, but may also need access to site-related
    facilaties within the game.
 -- Add FCOUNT() and FDEPTH() for softcode access to function invocation
    and nesting counters.
 -- Added POWERS() function to return a space-delimited list of powers.
    PennMUSH implement this first.
 -- Added some plumbing for SQL.  There is no way to make SQL queries,
    but @ps would show them if there were.  @halt and @kick would also
    interact with them.
 -- Added CHOOSE().  CHOOSE() is like PICKRAND() except that the
    distribution is weighted.  The idea was originally implemented by
    Catherine@Firan.  The code included here is based on a
    re-implementation of that in TM3.1 by Lydia.
 -- Added TEXTFILE() to allow easier softcode access to helpfile topics.
    Re-implemented from TM3.1 help topic.  Originally from PennMUSH.
 -- Added guests_channel_alias and public_channel_alias configuration
    options.
 -- Extended behavior of MID() to more easily cover the LEFT() and
    RIGHT() behaviors.
 -- Added optional second argument to RAND().
 -- Added patch surface for BTMUX.
 -- @teleport/list accepts a space-delimited list of objects to
    teleport.
 -- Added cemit().  Also, changed the permission control so that any
    object that controls the channel owner can use cemit()/@cemit.
 -- vadd() now allows addition of a vector by a scalar similiar to
    vmul().
 -- Remove the 20-argument limit from the vector functions.
 -- Added @mfail message. When @mail/lock rejects @mail, the @mfail is
    shown to the sender. Previously, the @reject message was shown to
    the sender.
 -- Added NO_PARSE attribute flag to control whether $-commands and
    ^-listens match the evaluated or unevaluated input.
 -- @program now traverses an object's parents for the requested
    attribute.
 -- Fixed @mail/fwd to evalute the postpended and prepended text without
    evaluating the forwarded text.
 -- Added the local.cpp patch surface. Details in LOCAL readme.


Bug Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~
 -- Solaris build needed a missing HAVE_FCNTL_H.
 -- First argument argument of udefault(), edefault(), and default()
    supported <dbref>/<attrname>, but not just <attrname>.  But
    introduced in MUX 2.2 timeframe.
 -- While the server hasn't allowed mail aliases (@malias) larger than
    100 members for awhile, it did not protect itself properly against
    mail aliases saved in older mail.db files.
 -- @backup now works with MEMORY_BASED build.
 -- Added missing @fsay help topic.
 -- Added more messages to @destroy/instant path.
 -- Guest attributes weren't being wiped as intended.
 -- Fixed @hook IGSWITCH again.  This time, the bug is related to the
    search_nametab() interface.
 -- Fix @notify/foo123 where foo123 is a never-before-used attributes.
    Legacy bug from MUX 1.6.
 -- Tightend up command piping to log expensive piped commands and also
    improve the interaction with @break and lag_limit.
 -- Fixed bug in MIX() where '&mixit me=(%0|%1);think mix(mixit,0 1,1)'
    gives '(0|1)' instead of '(0|1) (1|)'.  It wasn't determining the
    length of the first list correctly.
 -- Allow code on rooms to use @oemit.
 -- Move initialization of time code further up so that the logging
    code creates the right timestamp.
 -- @dbck started fixing quotas in MUX 2.3, but this is too expensive
    to do routinely.
 -- Locks failed to evaluate properly after a dbref within the lock was
    @destroy.
 -- Add ',()^$' to the set of characters escaped by ESCAPE().
 -- Fix unlikely but reproducible case of hanging @dump/@backup.
 -- Fixed suggestions/bugs from static analysis tool.
 -- Fixed some 64-bit warnings.
 -- Release comsys and @mail properly for guests.
 -- Document the see_hidden @power.
 -- Attribute permissions are documented more completely in the
    'attribute permission' topic.
 -- Clarified help topics 'helpfile' and 'raw_helpfile'.
 -- The minimal set of guests were never being added back to the Guests
    channel.
 -- @hook/igswitch tweaked so that if any switch from the user doesn't
    match the built-in hardcoded switched, softcode has a chance to
    process the command.
 -- Defer closing a session until output is completely flushed
    (Win32-only issue).
 -- Don't destroy a channel just because a controlling object is @nuked.
 -- Fixed SIGSEGV in AFTER() with accent characters in the pattern.
 -- Fixed uninitialized variable problem with an empty ladd().  It
    returned the result of the last operation.
 -- Fix permission hole where a @lock can be used to obtain someone's
    location.
 -- Fix TRIM() so that it doesn't leave a separator on the right side.
 -- Remove the different 'Icons' appearance from a MATRIX room.  There
    are other ways of accomplishing the same effect now.
 -- Document @queuemax and @cboot/quiet.
 -- Let band(), bor(), and bxor() take a variable number of arguments.
 -- Added strmem() to return the number of bytes required to represent
    a string in memory. strlen() returns the visual length of a string.
 -- Allow vadd() and vsub() to mix vector or scalar arguments.
 -- Allow conn_timeout of 0 indicate that connection timeouts should be
    disabled.
 -- Limit the number of pcreates permitted per hour to be controlled by
    pcreate_per_hour configuration option.
 -- When a user disconnect or connects, announce their presence on a 
    channel once regardless of how many aliases they have for that
    channel.
 -- Add case-insensitive sort option to sort().
 -- Use correct units in the @mail, attriute name, and new player
    throttles.
 -- Avoid several situations in which the forked process and main
    process would both attempt to update an attribute value. The forked
    process should never attempt to update any attributes values.
 -- Traverse pcache list properly (introduced in 2.4.0.15) to avoid
    orphaning cache records and failing to flush A_MONEY updates to the
    database.
 -- Fix crashing bug in @clist/full with a heavily ANSI-ied owner name.
 -- Documented @mail/bcc (blind carbon-copy).
 -- The $GAMENAME.pid file option in mux.config was not surviving
    @restart.
 -- Fixes for @mail and @program from 2.4.0.17 changes.
 -- Add FreeBSD-friendly checks for ieeefp.h to choose double-precision
    floating-point properly on FreeBSD.
 -- Add Solaris-friendly checks for fenv.h, fesetprec(), and
    fegetprec() to choose double-precision floating-point properly on
    Solaris without inadvertently trying to use fenv.h on MacOS or SuSE.
 -- local_data_create() in local.cpp was not being called for the
    create() side-effect function.  Found and fixed by Alierak.
 -- lstack() left a trailing output separator (space).  It also contains
    some unreachable code.  Found and fixed by Alierak.
 -- VDIM() referenced uninitialized memory.  Borrowed the correct
    implementaiton from WORDS() since the two are nearly identical.
    Found and fixed by Alierak.
 -- Fix @mail/quick evaluation from 2.4.0.18 so that spaces are not
    compressed.


Performance Enhancements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Re-worked update_quotas() so that mudstate.now could be removed.
 -- Use nanosleep() or usleep() on Unix if available.
 -- Pulled alloc/free pairs outside an inner loop in switch() and
    fold().
 -- Improve performance by avoiding write-through caching of A_MONEY in
    the player cache. This was probably the primary reason for needing
    one cached hash page per player. Paging is probably secondary to
    this one.


Cosmetic Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Increased the space available to WHO for @moniker names to provide
    more room for more ANSI transitions.
 -- Remove references to have_macros in wizhelp.txt


Miscellaneous:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Added ATTACK notes.
 -- Added @folder as an alias for @mail/folder and @file as an alias for
    @mail/file.
 -- Remove configure checks for mktime() and timelocal().
 -- Alierak removed the last two direct uses of delim_check in lnum()
    and lcmds().
