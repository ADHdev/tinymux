TinyMUX 2.4:  CHANGES
Last Update:  April 2004

Major changes that may affect performance and require softcode tweaks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- XXX


Feature Additions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Added support for multi-character delimiters across nearly all
    functions which accept input or output delimiters.  For example,
    'iter(1%r2%r3,itext(),%r,|)' produces '1|2|3'.
 -- Added 'reset_players' configuration option which resets the player
    connection record.
 -- Added 'user_attrib_per_hour' which limits the rate at which
    user-defined attributes are created.
 -- Added 'mail_per_hour' which limits the rate at which @mail can be
    created.
 -- Add output delimiter to elements(), extract(), filter(),
    filterbool(), graball(), remove(), shuffle(), sortby(), and
    splice().


Bug Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~
 -- Solaris build needed a missing HAVE_FCNTL_H.
 -- First argument argument of udefault(), edefault(), and default()
    supported <dbref>/<attrname>, but not just <attrname>.  But
    introduced in MUX 2.2 timeframe.
 -- While the server hasn't allowed mail aliases (@malias) larger than
    100 members for awhile, it did not protect itself properly against
    mail aliases saved in older mail.db files.
 -- @backup now works with MEMORY_BASED build.


Performance Enhancements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- XXX


Cosmetic Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Increased the space available to WHO for @moniker names to provide
    more room for more ANSI transitions.


Miscellaneous:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Added ATTACK notes.
