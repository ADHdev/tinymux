TinyMUX 2.2:  CHANGES
Last Update:  June 2002

Major changes that may affect performance and require softcode tweaks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Removed support for RADIX_COMPRESSION.
 -- Related to %@ (caller) below, some functions have altered (enactor,
    caller, executor) than MUX 2.1. In some places, these changes fixed
    what can certainly be argued as wrong behavior. In some places,
    the changes are made for the sake of consistency across the codebase.


Feature Additions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Bug #323 - Implemented %@ (caller) substitution as defined previously
    by PennMUSH.
 -- Replaced Spencer's regmatch package with Perl regular expressions (PCRE).
    Implemented by Raevnos.
 -- Turned on fractional seconds for time(), secs(), convtime(), and
    convsecs().
 -- Bug #743 - @doing should allow /unique switch to specify only current
    port.  Patch from Jake.
 -- Bug #556 - Add PennMUSH's right() function. Patch from Jake.
 -- Bugs #567 and #806 - Add connrecord() that gives the most simultaneous
    connections to the game. Patch from Jake.
 -- Bugs #553 and #795 - Add host() function. Patch from Jake.
 -- Bugs #554, #636, #741, and #742 - doing(), cmds(), idle(), conn(), and 
    host() take port# as an argument. Patch from Jake.
 -- Added @cboot/quiet. Patch from Zenty.
 -- Implemented SPELLNUM() with PennMUSH behavior except that the
    two-digit-hundred-pattern is sometimes used (e.g, 'spellnum(1100)' -->
    'eleven hundred' on MUX 2.2 whereas on PennMUSH, 'spellnum(1100)' -->
    'one thousand one hundred'.
 -- Added ROMAN() function which converts numbers between 1-3999 to their
    Roman numeric equivalents.
 -- Changed BOOLEAN VALUES to be consistent more PennMUSH. I needed to be
    able to handle '#-2 AMBIGUOUS' at the least.
 -- In MUX 2.0 and 2.1, many functions would notify the enactor of certain
    error messages (e.g., I don't know which one you mean). This has been
    removed in favor of returning '#-2 AMBIGIOUS' and other error messages
    like '#-1 PERMISSION DENIED', "#-1 NOT FOUND', etc. Command continue
    notify the enactor.

Bug Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~
 -- @mvattr would erase source attribute even if it wasn't allowed to write to
    any of its destinations.
 -- Fixed isnum() with exponents. Uninitialized structure.
 -- Added @dbck/full. Allows in-game access to an option previously only 
    available via dbconvert -c. Patch from Jake.
 -- Rework of dbck routines. More thorough checking and removed some God-only
    crash issues. Patch from Jake.
 -- Fixed entire class of bugs from MUX 1.x that show themselves to one degree
    or another in nearly every part of the server. The issue was first visible
    with enter locks on zones.
 -- Fixed ancient filter() bug where only a prefix of '1' was counted as true.
    Fixed by Raevnos.
 -- All possible return values from match() are not handled properly. Ancient
    class of bugs which are still present in MUX 2.0, 2.1, MUSH 3.0, and
    MUSH 3.1 Beta. It can cause memory just before the database structure to
    be read from, but it doesn't appear to crash on either Win32 or Unix.
    Apparently an ancient bug.


Performance Enhancements:

Cosmetic Changes:
