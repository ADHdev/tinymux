TinyMUX 2.2:  CHANGES
Last Update:  July 2002

Major changes that may affect performance and require softcode tweaks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Removed support for RADIX_COMPRESSION.
 -- Related to %@ (caller) below, some functions have altered (enactor,
    caller, executor) than MUX 2.1. In some places, these changes fixed
    what can certainly be argued as wrong behavior. In some places,
    the changes are made for the sake of consistency across the codebase.
 -- convtime() now returns '#-1 INVALID DATE' instead of -1 when it cannot
    parse the time string because '-1' is a valid time stamp.


Feature Additions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Bug #323 - Implemented %@ (caller) substitution as defined previously
    by PennMUSH.
 -- Replaced Spencer's regmatch package with Perl regular expressions (PCRE).
    Implemented by Raevnos.
 -- Turned on fractional seconds for time(), secs(), convtime(), and
    convsecs().
 -- Bug #743 - @doing should allow /unique switch to specify only current
    port.  Patch from Jake.
 -- Bug #556 - Add PennMUSH's right() function. Patch from Jake.
 -- Bugs #567 and #806 - Add connrecord() that gives the most simultaneous
    connections to the game. Patch from Jake.
 -- Bugs #553 and #795 - Add host() function. Patch from Jake.
 -- Bugs #554, #636, #741, and #742 - doing(), cmds(), idle(), conn(), and 
    host() take port# as an argument. Patch from Jake.
 -- Added @cboot/quiet. Patch from Zenty.
 -- Implemented SPELLNUM() with PennMUSH behavior except that the
    two-digit-hundred-pattern is sometimes used (e.g, 'spellnum(1100)' -->
    'eleven hundred' on MUX 2.2 whereas on PennMUSH, 'spellnum(1100)' -->
    'one thousand one hundred'.
 -- Added ROMAN() function which converts numbers between 1-3999 to their
    Roman numeric equivalents.
 -- Changed BOOLEAN VALUES to be consistent more PennMUSH. I needed to be
    able to handle '#-2 AMBIGUOUS' at the least.
 -- In MUX 2.0 and 2.1, many functions would notify the enactor of certain
    error messages (e.g., I don't know which one you mean). This has been
    removed in favor of returning '#-2 AMBIGUOUS' and other error messages
    like '#-1 PERMISSION DENIED', "#-1 NOT FOUND', etc. Command continue
    notify the enactor.
 -- Added optional argument to lwho() to request the return the corresponding
    port numbers. Patch by Jake.
 -- Added optional argument to channels to get channels for a particular
    player. Patch by Jake.
 -- Added filterbool(). Patch by Jake.
 -- Added non-evaluating say and pose. Patch by Jake.
 -- Permit '#' and '.' as leading attribute name characters.
 -- Log files on the Unix distribution are now handled by the server instead
    of the Startmux script in the same way that log files are handled by
    Win32 distribution. That is, log files are limited to 500KB in size, and
    the server creates log files with the name <mudname>-<date>-<time>.log.
 -- Jake added non-evaluating say/noeval and pose/noeval which are aliased
    to nsay and npose.
 -- Jake added history support for the comsys history. The command is
    '<alias> last[ <n>]'.  See @cset/log. It requires that the channel have an
    associated channel object.
 -- Added ANDBOOL(), CAND(), CANDBOOL(), COR(), CORBOOL(), LAND(), LOR(), and
    ORBOOL().
 -- Jake added CTU() which stands for 'Convert Trigometric Units' for
    compatibility with RhostMUSH.
 -- Jake added optional argument to CHANNELS() to restict the list to channels
    owned by a particular player.
 -- Jake changed config() so that if used with an argument, would return a
    list of available configuration options that are available to that
    particular player.
 -- Adds optional precision argument to time(), secs(), convtime(), convsecs().
    By default, the precision is 0 decimal places, but up to 7 decimal places
    can be requested. Some parts of the server always record 7 decimal places
    (connection times, object creation and modification times). Some parts of
    the server continue to use 0 decimal places (@mail).
 -- Added FILTERBOOL().
 -- LWHO() now has an optional argument which also returns the port number
    with the player's dbref. Added by Jake.
 -- Jake added @ICMD from RhostMUSH which stands for 'Ignore Command'. It's
    a GOD-only command for selectively disabling access to certain commands,
    exits, triggers, etc. against certain players or within certain rooms.
 -- Added HTML attribute flag.
 -- Remove player objects cleanly from @malias and as channel objects at @toad
    and @destroy time. Added by Jake.
 -- Added power_alias configuration option.
 -- Jake made the arguments to PLAYMEM() and STATS() optional.
 -- Jake added the ability to retract @mail from a @malias.
 -- SUSPECT messages now report partial connections/disconnections. Added by
    Jake.
 -- Jake added @if (originally from ChaoticMUX).
 -- Allow '#' and '.' as leading first characters in attribute names.

Bug Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~
 -- @mvattr would erase source attribute even if it wasn't allowed to write to
    any of its destinations.
 -- Fixed isnum() with exponents. Uninitialized structure.
 -- Added @dbck/full. Allows in-game access to an option previously only 
    available via dbconvert -c. Patch from Jake.
 -- Rework of dbck routines. More thorough checking and removed some God-only
    crash issues. Patch from Jake.
 -- Fixed entire class of bugs from MUX 1.x that show themselves to one degree
    or another in nearly every part of the server. The issue was first visible
    with enter locks on zones.
 -- Fixed ancient filter() bug where only a prefix of '1' was counted as true.
    Fixed by Raevnos.
 -- Fix uninitialized variable in a utility object used by LROOMS(). Also a
    bug in MUX 2.0 and MUX 2.1. A patch for those will be provided separately.
 -- Fixed SIGSEGV bug in ANSI_String_Copy() which is used by CENTER/LJUST/RJUST
    softcode functions.


Performance Enhancements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Optimized check_access() hardcode function which is frequently used.
 -- Took out unnecessary test against Tiny_IsASCII character class in bsd.cpp


Cosmetic Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Added grammatically correct comma after 'shouts'.

Miscellaneous:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Added nattr (so named by TM3) as an alias for attrcnt (pre-existing MUX2
    feature).
