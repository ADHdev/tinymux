TinyMUX 2.6:  CHANGES
Last Update:  August 2006

Major changes that may affect performance and require softcode tweaks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Deprecated LSTACK(), POP(), PUSH(), PEEK(), EMPTY(), and ITEMS().
    These functions are still available via the --enabled-deprecated
    configuration switch.  Requested by Ian.
 -- Port code to the 64-bit edition of Windows XP.  Jake and Brazil.


Feature Additions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- FCOUNT(<expression>) to tally function invocations in <expression>.
    Requested by Ian.
 -- Add SITEINFO() to return the site flags for a player or port.  Added
    by Jake.
 -- Use Moniker instead of name in enter/leave emits, rob, kill, @toad,
    boot, and in other similar situations.
 -- Add support for %=<attr> substitution. From TinyMUSH 3.
 -- Use localtime_r() if available. By Brazil.
 -- Added command line switch (-n) to control choice of networking
    method on Win32.
 -- Added support for 2-argument mix().
 -- Added optional third 'step' parameter to lnum().
 -- Added optional second argument for lcon() for subseting the returned
    list by type.
 -- The 'You own a floating room' message is only given for rooms which
    are not connected to either the player_startint_room or to a room
    marked FLOATING. Previously, every room not connected to the
    player_starting_room had to be marked FLOATING.
 -- Added QUELL flag from Firan to temorarily supress Wizard powers.
 -- Added @switch/notify.
 -- Merge Firan MUX source modification and collected them under the
    --enable-firanmux ./configuration switch. This also typically
    requires the --enable-memorybased switch.
 -- Added --enable-firanmuxconvert which turns on code to remap two
    conflicting attribute numbers. The first database load will require
    this switch, and then it should be turned off.


Bug Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~
 -- Fix over one thousand level 4 warnings.  Jake and Brazil.
 -- Deprecate use of strcpy() and strncpy().  Jake and Brazil.
 -- Use size_t where appropriate.  Jake and Brazil.
 -- Deprecate use of sprintf().  By Brazil.
 -- Deprecate use of localtime().  By Brazil.
 -- Fix 'round(-0.5,0)' --> '-0' to be '0' instead.
 -- Disallow the train command from being used on itself.
 -- Add protection to @chownall that victim be a player object.
 -- Fix uninitialized variable in HASRXLEVEL(). It should have used
    'executor' instead of 'player'.
 -- Fix time_t handling for 64-bit machines. Timezones could be wrong
    for dates earlier than Jan 1 1970 on 64-bit Unix.
 -- Fix @hook for goto command. Being unable to move also affected the
    ability to use other commands. Reported by K hall.
 -- Added checking to convsecs() to return '#-1 INVALID DATE" if first
    argument is outside the supported range.


Performance Enhancements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 -- In MEMORY_BASED, avoid malloc() call each time an attribute is
    added to an object.

Cosmetic Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Miscellaneous:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Add mux_fopen() utility function to replace direct use of fopen().
