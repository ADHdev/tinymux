TinyMUX 2.2:  CHANGES
Last Update:  June 2002

Major changes that may affect performance and require softcode tweaks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Removed support for RADIX_COMPRESSION.
 -- Related to %@ (caller) below, some functions have altered (enactor,
    caller, executor) than MUX 2.1. In some places, these changes fixed
    what can certainly be argued as wrong behavior. In some places,
    the changes are made for the sake of consistency across the codebase.


Feature Additions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Bug #323 - Implemented %@ (caller) substitution as defined previously
    by PennMUSH.
 -- Replaced Spencer's regmatch package with Perl regular expressions (PCRE).
    Implemented by Raevnos.
 -- Turned on fractional seconds for time(), secs(), convtime(), and
    convsecs().
 -- Bug #743 - @doing should allow /unique switch to specify only current
    port.  Patch from Jake.
 -- Bug #556 - Add PennMUSH's right() function. Patch from Jake.
 -- Bugs #567 and #806 - Add connrecord() that gives the most simultaneous
    connections to the game. Patch from Jake.
 -- Bugs #553 and #795 - Add host() function. Patch from Jake.
 -- Bugs #554, #636, #741, and #742 - doing(), cmds(), idle(), conn(), and 
    host() take port# as an argument. Patch from Jake.
 -- Added @cboot/quiet. Patch from Zenty.
 -- Implemented SPELLNUM() with PennMUSH behavior except that the
    two-digit-hundred-pattern is sometimes used (e.g, 'spellnum(1100)' -->
    'eleven hundred' on MUX 2.2 whereas on PennMUSH, 'spelnum(1100)' -->
    'one thousand one hundred'.
 -- Added ROMAN() function which converts numbers between 1-3999 to their
    Roman numeric equivalents.

Bug Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~
 -- @mvattr would erase source attribute even if it wasn't allowed to write to
    any of its destinations.
 -- Fixed isnum() with exponents. Uninitialized structure.
 -- Added @dbck/full. Allows in-game access to an option previously only 
    available via dbconvert -c. Patch from Jake.
 -- Rework of dbck routines. More thorough checking and removed some God-only
    crash issues. Patch from Jake.
 -- Fixed entire class of bugs from MUX 1.x that show themselves to one degree
    or another in nearly every part of the server. The issue was first visible
    with enter locks on zones.

Cosmetic Changes:
