TinyMUX 2.2:  LIMITS
Last Update:  January 2003

While some limits of the server depend on the host environment (CPU
architecture, compiler, and operating system), there are certain univeral
limits, and we can also describe typical limits on typical platforms.

The 8000 character limit:

Attribute values, global registers, function arguments, internal
intermediate buffers, and @mail bodies are typical limited to approximately
8000 characters.  However, you aren't always able to use the full 8000
characters because a null ('\0') character is needed at the end, ANSI
color codes require their own space, and for attributes, the owner and
attribute flags are encoded at the beginning of the buffer.  This effectively
reduces its usable size.

Object Limit:

The number of objects is limited to the maximum value on a 'signed integer'.

Attribute Name Limit:

The number of unique attribute names is limited to the maximum value of a
'signed integer'.

Attributes per Object:

In MUX 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2, the number of attributes that can be associated
with an object is limited to somewhere between 2000 and 4000 depending
on the number of unique attribute names game-wide and in particular which
ones are used.

Range and precision of Dates:

MUX supports a proleptic Gregorian calendar with dates in the range of
'Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 -27256 UTC' through 'Thu Dec 31 23:59:59 30826 UTC'
which corresponds to -922283539200 through 910638979199.  The precision is
100 nanoseconds, and 0 (the epoch) corresponds to
'Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 -27256 UTC'.

MUX does not account for leap seconds.  It does however, take into account
what is called 'Summer Time' or 'Daylight Savings Time'.


Typical Platform Limits:

A 'signed integer' is typically 32-bits and can represent values from
-2147483648 through 2147483647.

Many platforms employ the IEEE floating-point formats. The range of
floating-point numbers which may be represented is approximately 1e-323
through 1e+308.
